# PY4Ecertificate

## Prologue

This README file describes the files uploaded that I developed as a personal capstone project for the [PY4E certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).

I really enjoyed it, so I encourage you to try it if you are curious about programming! 

It took me about three weeks to finish on a part-time basis.

## Introduction

This project sought to produce a map of all commercial outlets who had a fine for food safety violations in the city of Montreal (since 2011).

[The dataset can be found here](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/vmtl-inspection-aliments-contrevenants/resource/7f939a08-be8a-45e1-b208-d8744dca8fc6)

Importantly, the dataset does not have geographical coordinates. Great for flexing my newfound skills in a capstone project!

The project is done in three steps:

1. Writing a 1st Python program to access data from the city of Montreal's API and create a local SQLite database.
2. Writing a 2nd Python program to access data from OpenStreetMap's API and match outlets' address with coordinates.
3. Writing a 3rd Python program to visualise these coordinates using the Folium library.

This repository therefore contains the three Python files, the SQLite database, and one .html file with the map.

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions (email: thierrygagne@gmail.com).

Cheers,
